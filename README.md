# MVC: The model-view-controller
This is a lecture that explains what is MVC
# What is it
MVC is an architectural paradigm in software development that deals with separation of concerns. It is used in the creation of apps by separating the project in three logical components:

1. The model: Handles all the data and deals with the database as well as some logic. It specifies which data is going to be in the app.
2. Views: Handles the design and presentation, basically what the user sees and interacts with.
3. the controller: Handles the routes that will be used by the model and the views in the serving of data and files and also handles the server-side logic.

This separation facilitates maintenance and eases the work flow. It is also used by many web frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, Laravel, CakePHP, Django and more.
